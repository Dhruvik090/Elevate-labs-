 Step 2: Examine the Sender’s Email Address

* Email Shown: `support@apple-security.com`
*  It appears official but...
*  It’s not from Apple! The correct domain should be `@apple.com`.
*  This is email spoofing — attackers use a look-alike domain to deceive recipients.

 Step 3: Analyze the Email Header (Using Free Online Header Analyzer)

Tool Used: [MxToolbox Email Header Analyzer](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx)

* SPF Result: Fail (email not authorized by apple.com)
* DKIM Result: Not signed
* IP Reputation: Low reputation / blacklisted
* ➤ Shows clear signs of spoofing and potential spam.

---

 Step 4: Identify Suspicious Links or Attachments

* Link Given: `https://apple-secure-login.com/verify`
* Hovering shows that it doesn’t go to Apple’s official site.
* The domain is fake and likely a phishing site.
* Attachment: `Apple-ID-Verification-Form.pdf`

  * ➤ Could contain malicious scripts or ask for login credentials.

---

 Step 5: Look for Urgent or Threatening Language

* Phrases like:

  * “Your account will be permanently suspended”
  * “Urgent: Your Apple ID Has Been Locked!”
* ➤ Creates panic to trick users into acting quickly.

---

 Step 6: Check for Mismatched URLs

* Text says: Click here to verify
* Actual URL: `https://apple-secure-login.com`
* Mismatch = phishing red flag

---

 Step 7: Verify Spelling and Grammar

* Phrase: “verify your identity” – vague, no personalization
* “Thank you, Apple Security Team” – doesn’t match Apple’s usual formatting
* ➤ Slight but noticeable grammatical issues
