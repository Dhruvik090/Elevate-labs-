 Cyber Security Internship ‚Äì Task 5

 Task: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

 üéØ Objective

To capture live network packets using Wireshark, analyze the data, and identify multiple network protocols like ICMP, DNS, and TCP. This task helps in building hands-on skills in traffic inspection, filtering, and protocol understanding.

 üõ† Tools & Setup

- Tool Used: Wireshark (Dark Mode)
- System Used: Windows (Taskbar shown in screenshots)
- Capture File: `my_capture.pcapng`
- Traffic Generated By:
  - Pinging servers (for ICMP)
  - Visiting websites (YouTube, Google)
  - HTTPS sessions (for TCP analysis)

---

 üîç Protocols Identified

 1. üü° ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

- Filter Used: `icmp`
- Source: `192.168.113.253`  
- Destination: `192.168.113.22`
- Status Observed: `Destination unreachable (Port unreachable)`
- Explanation:
  - ICMP is used for diagnostics (e.g., `ping`) and error reporting.
  - These packets show that the target machine is reachable, but the port is closed or there‚Äôs no service running on it.
  - Often triggered when scanning or probing inactive services.
- Real Use: Network troubleshooting, ping response analysis, error detection.

 2. üü¢ DNS (Domain Name System)

- Filter Used: `dns`
- Observation:
  - Multiple domain queries observed including:
    - `www.google.com`
    - `www.youtube.com`
    - `studio.youtube.com`
  - Query types include:
    - `A` (IPv4)
    - `AAAA` (IPv6)
    - `CNAME` (Canonical name)
- Explanation:
  - DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses.
  - It's often the first step in initiating a web request.
- Use Case: DNS visibility helps track where a device is connecting online.

---

 3. üîµ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

- Filter Used: `tcp`
- Observation:
  - Captured traffic shows:
    - 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
    - Secure session establishment on port 443
    - TLSv1.3 Application Data packets
- Explanation:
  - TCP provides reliable data transfer via session establishment and retransmission.
  - Many packets were encrypted (HTTPS traffic).
- Use Case: TCP reassembly helps in protocol analysis, secure browsing insight, and forensic examination.

 ‚úÖ Conclusion

This task provided valuable insight into real-world packet analysis. By filtering traffic for key protocols, I understood:

- How hosts communicate over networks
- The importance of DNS in browsing
- How ICMP errors help troubleshoot connectivity
- How TCP establishes reliable sessions

Wireshark is a must-have tool for any cyber security learner or professional.
