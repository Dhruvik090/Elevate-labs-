 🧪 Password Tests and Evaluation

 🔹 1. Password: akshay
- Score: 7%
- Complexity: Very Weak
- Issues: Too short, only lowercase letters, no numbers or symbols

 🔹 2. Password: akshay123
- Score: 40%
- Complexity: Good
- Issues: Lacks uppercase letters and special symbols

 🔹 3. Password: Akshay123
- Score: 69%
- Complexity: Strong
- Improvements: Added uppercase letter, but still lacks symbols

 🔹 4. Password: Akshay@123
- Score: 87%
- Complexity: Very Strong
- Result: Balanced, secure, includes all required character types

 🔹 5. Password: Ak$h@y_123
- Score: 100%
- Complexity: Very Strong
- Result: Excellent complexity, includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and multiple symbols

 📚 Common Password Attacks

 1. 💣 Brute Force Attack
- Tries all possible combinations until the correct password is found.
- Defense: Use long and complex passwords, enable account lockouts, and use MFA.

 2. 📚 Dictionary Attack
- Tries a list of common passwords or leaked credentials.
- Defense: Avoid common words and patterns, use randomness, and symbols.

 🧠 How Password Complexity Affects Security

- Length and variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) increase resistance to attacks.
- Unpredictable and unique passwords are harder to crack.
- More complexity = higher entropy = stronger defense.

Example:
- Weak: password123
- Strong: T!m3@R!ver_2025

 ✅ Tips for Strong Passwords

- Use 12+ characters
- Mix upper/lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Don’t reuse passwords
- Avoid personal names or dictionary words
- Use passphrases like My_Dog@Barks2025
- Consider using a password manager
